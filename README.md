# Traffic Flow Prediction with PySpark

This project utilizes PySpark to analyze and predict traffic flow patterns based on available datasets.

## Project Description

The notebook includes the following key components:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Handled using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
2. **Visualization:** 
   - Implemented with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. **PySpark Implementation:**
   - Configured Spark session for handling large-scale data.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

## Configure PySpark
Ensure Spark is correctly set up in your environment.

## Run the Notebook
Open the notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook lab_assignment.ipynb
```
## Project Structure

- **lab_assignment.ipynb:** Main notebook containing the code and analysis.
- **Data files:** Ensure your dataset is in the correct path specified within the notebook.
